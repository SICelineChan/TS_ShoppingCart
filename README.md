# TS_ShoppingCart

Hello there,
I've been revising React and put most of the codes on Code Sandbox, so after some much needed updates, I want to begin to do a bit of TypeScript. I'm using some of the materials from Web Dev Simplified on Youtube.
Instead of using Bootstrap, I am going to use MUI for a little challenge and another chance of some CSS practice. 
Most of the updates will probably be on the weekends for June 2023, my timetable is pretty packed during weekdays, let's see how much I can get this done and move back to my Hotel Calculation App!
